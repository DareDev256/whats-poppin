# Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### Security
- Added Subresource Integrity (SRI) hash for CDN-loaded Phaser script — prevents supply chain attacks
- Added Content-Security-Policy meta tag restricting script/style/connect sources
- Hardened localStorage reads with explicit radix and NaN guards on `parseInt`
- Sanitized score writes to prevent storing non-numeric values

### Fixed
- Service worker now caches the actual CDN URL for Phaser instead of a non-existent `node_modules/` path — offline play actually works now
- Bumped service worker cache version to `whatspoppin-v2` to invalidate stale caches
